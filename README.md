In this repository I tried to create a logging system for both windows and linux ! If possible I want to create a single application that is usable on both Windows/Linux other wise gonna create two different branches one for Windows and another one for linux ! 

For any networking the core concept lies in socket so for the current project I am gonna using socket libraries written in c and python3 ( These two are the only language I know ðŸ¤£)!
